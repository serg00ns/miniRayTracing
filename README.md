# Minimal Ray Tracer – C

miniRayTracing is a small ray-tracing engine implemented in C. It renders simple 3D scenes by computing light, shadow, and object interactions mathematically. The project uses MiniLibX to create a display window and draw pixels in real time.

The purpose of this program is to manually implement the fundamentals of ray tracing: ray–object intersections, surface normals, lighting equations, and camera projection. Everything is written from scratch without external graphics libraries.
